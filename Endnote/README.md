# Endnote

The files in this directory describe a simple way of creating, managing,
and formatting endnotes in plain text (ASCII) documents.

This method uses a *very* lightweight markup system for indicating note
references in a text file. The user employs a script to number the
references, collect the note bodies, and move them to the end of the text
document.

At the present time (December 2023), the Endnote conversion script exists
for two common languages, awk and perl.
